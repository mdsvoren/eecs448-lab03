    </h2>
    <p>
        Conceived in the nascent days of 2003, Michael's Selmer Serie III Alto Saxophone remains in its prime playing days.
        The smooth ergonomic touch combined with the twinkle of the pearls and the radiance of the brilliant lacquer influence 
        the power of the music emanating from the horn's bell. Notable performances include at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland,
        the Vienne Jazz Festival in France, and the Umbria Jazz Festival in Italy. This horn has shared the limelight with international
        superstars such as Deborah Brown, Matt Otto, Bobby Watson, Tia Fuller, and Anat Cohen.
